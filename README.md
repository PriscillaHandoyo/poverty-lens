## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/priscillahandoyo/poverty-lens.git
    cd poverty-lens
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install streamlit pandas joblib matplotlib plotly fpdf
    ```

3. **Prepare your data and model:**
    - Place cleaned CSV files in `data/dataset/`:
        - `cleaned_SDR-2025-poverty-headcount-ratio-at-2-15-day.csv`
        - `cleaned_SDR-2025-poverty-headcount-ratio-at-3-65-day.csv`
        - `cleaned_SDR-2025-poverty-rate-after-taxes-and-transfers.csv`
    - Place your trained model in `models/poverty_risk_model.pkl`.

## Data Requirements

Your merged dataset should include:

- `Country`: Country name
- `ISO`: ISO country code (for map visualization)
- `Region` or `Income Group`: For regional comparison (optional but recommended)
- Yearly poverty indicators:
    - `{YEAR}_215`: Poverty headcount ratio at $2.15/day
    - `{YEAR}_365`: Poverty headcount ratio at $3.65/day
    - `{YEAR}`: Poverty rate after taxes and transfers

**Example columns:**  
`Country`, `ISO`, `Region`, `2025_215`, `2025_365`, `2025`, etc.
